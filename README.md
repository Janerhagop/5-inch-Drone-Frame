Welcome to the 5 Inch FPV Drone Frame project! This is a custom-designed frame for a 5-inch FPV (First-Person View) racing or freestyle drone, created using SolidWorks. The design is optimized for both lightweight performance and durability, making it suitable for high-speed FPV drone racing or acrobatic freestyle flying.
Included in this repository are DXF files that are ready to be used for laser cutting, allowing you to easily manufacture the frame components.
## Features
- Size: Designed for 5-inch propellers, ideal for racing and freestyle.
- Material: Intended for carbon fiber or similar lightweight and durable materials.
- Design Software: Modeled in SolidWorks for precise and optimized geometry.
- Modularity: Frame is designed for easy assembly and disassembly.
- Laser-Cutting Ready: Includes DXF files that are prepped and optimized for CNC laser cutting.
- You Can use this Frame with the F4/F7 Stack Flight Controller and 4in1 Esc (Electronic Speed Controller).
- ## Assembly Instructions
1. Cutting the Components  
   Use a CNC laser cutter to cut the provided DXF files from 2-5mm carbon fiber sheets or other suitable materials.
2. Assembly  
   - Arms: Attach the arms to the bottom plate using (M4x14mm) Hex Button Screws and lock nuts(also attach Center Plate to the Arms and Bottom Plate).
   - Top Plate: Secure the top plate with standoffs to maintain frame rigidity.
   - Ensure all parts are properly aligned and tightly secured.
   - Note:Mounting System Provided in the Assembly file.
3. Motor Mounting  
   The arms are designed to fit standard 2205 to 2306 motors. Use the provided holes to secure the motors with (M3x8mm) Hex Cap Screws.
- Top Frame and Standoffs can be connected using (M3x6mm) Hex Button Screws.
- Also the Bottom Frame and Standoffs Can be connected using (M3x6mm) Hex Button Screws.
- You can Mount the Fligh controller Stack using M3 Screws(Screws that comes with Fligh Controller)
## Materials
- Recommended Material: Carbon fiber (2.5mm or 5mm thickness for frame components).
- Fasteners: M4 screws and lock nuts.
- Standoffs: 20-25-30mm aluminum or nylon standoffs for assembling the top and bottom plates.
- Top Plate: 2.5mm
- Bottom Plate: 2.5mm
- Center Plate: 2.5mm
- Arm Plate: 5mm or You can use 4mm
- ## Customization
The frame is fully customizable, and the SolidWorks files can be modified to suit your needs. Feel free to:
- Adjust arm length for different motor sizes or propeller dimensions.
- Modify the top plate design to accommodate custom electronics layouts.
- Add or remove components for weight optimization.
